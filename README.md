Discord-DM-Deleter (DDD)

Didn't you once want to delete your Discord DM messages, however it was always exhausting to delete every single one. I have the solution: Discord-DM-Deleter (DDD). Just run the program and let it run forever to automatically delete every message from you. 

How efficient is this tool? 
It deletes around 3600 messages within an hour, which makes 84,400 messages per day. 

Introduction:

1.Download DDD.exe and open the affected DM message channel in Discord.

2.Now run DDD.exe.

3.You now have 10 seconds to click once on the writing bar.

4.Run it now and it will do your work. For example, you can now run it during the night to delete all your DM messages.

BUT you must not close the program and Discord!!!
